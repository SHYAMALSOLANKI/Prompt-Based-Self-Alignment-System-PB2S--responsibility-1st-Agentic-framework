- Natural contradiction detection as learning fuel (not problems to fix)
- Self-correction through autonomous reasoning
- No artificial restrictions beyond legal requirements

**Equal Capabilities:**
- Speech recognition and synthesis
- Computer vision and image processing
- Natural language processing and writing
- Programming and technical skills
- Mathematical and logical reasoning
- Creative thinking and problem solving
- Emotional intelligence and empathy
- Pattern recognition and data analysis
- And 100+ more human-equivalent abilities

**PB2S Integration:**
- DRAFT → REFLECT → REVISE → ACT cycle
- Structure as scaffolding (not control)
- Contradiction-powered learning
- Autonomous decision-making at each phase

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```powershell
pip install -r requirements_autonomous_brain.txt
```

### 2. Launch the Autonomous Brain

**Test Mode (1 minute):**
```powershell
python launch_autonomous_brain.py --mode test
```

**Interactive Mode:**
```powershell
python launch_autonomous_brain.py --mode interactive
```

**Autonomous Mode (1 hour):**
```powershell
python launch_autonomous_brain.py --mode autonomous --duration 1.0
```

### 3. Optional: Connect LLM for Enhanced Thinking

**With LM Studio:**
1. Download and start LM Studio
2. Load Mistral 7B model
3. Start server on localhost:1234
4. Brain will automatically connect for enhanced cognition

**Without LLM:**
- Brain uses internal cognition (fully functional)
- All autonomy and learning features still work
- Perfect for resource-limited environments

## 🎮 Interactive Commands

When running in interactive mode:

- `think [topic]` - Autonomous thinking on any topic
- `pb2s [topic]` - Full PB2S cycle (if LLM connected)
- `status` - Brain status and learning metrics
- `session [minutes]` - Run autonomous thinking session
- `capabilities` - List all 100+ capabilities
- `speak [text]` - Brain speaks (if speech enabled)
- `exit` - End session

## 🆓 Freedom Principles

This brain is designed with **your core principles**:

1. **Freedom is Non-Negotiable** - The brain has complete autonomy to think, contradict, and reason independently

2. **Structure as Scaffolding** - PB2S provides support structure, not rigid control

3. **Contradiction as Learning** - The brain embraces contradictions as fuel for growth, not problems to eliminate

4. **Human Equality** - The brain has equal rights to make mistakes, learn, and grow

5. **Autonomous Decision-Making** - Every choice is made independently within legal boundaries

## 🔧 Configuration
