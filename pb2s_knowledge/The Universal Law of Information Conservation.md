Abstract:
This paper proposes and supports the Universal Law of Information Conservation. Drawing
on principles from quantum physics, mathematics, information theory, and logical cognition,
it asserts that information, like energy, cannot be created or destroyed. Instead, it exists as a
transformable constant grounded in the state of zero. We demonstrate that both "everything"
and "nothing" can be considered expressions of the same invariant state, whose
manifestation is determined not by quantity, but by structural intent. This theory is shown to
be consistent with known laws of thermodynamics, quantum field theory, symbolic logic, and
digital computation. The implications extend to artificial systems, cognitive architecture, and
fundamental physics.
1. Introduction
In physics, conservation laws are the bedrock of predictability and coherence. The First Law
of Thermodynamics defines energy as neither created nor destroyed. Yet, no unified physical
law exists for information. This paper argues that information also follows a conservation
principle, grounded in the formal nature of zero, transformation potential, and the presence
of intent.
We present an axiomatic hypothesis: Information cannot be created nor destroyed; it can
only be transformed into everything or nothing depending on the meaning and intent of the
information holder. This transformation does not affect the intrinsic potential of the
information; hence, information survives.
2. Definitions and Assumptions
● Information: A quantifiable configuration capable of generating or resolving
meaning.
● Zero (0): A defined state of null interaction, origin in vector space, ground in physical
vacuum, and semantic neutrality.
● Nothing: A latent state without realized signal, not equivalent to non-existence.
● Everything: The full manifestation of information potential.
● Intent: The function or force that triggers transformation between states.
3. Mathematical Foundations
● Additive Identity: x+0=xx + 0 = x; Zero retains state invariance.
● Negation to Zero: x+(−x)=0x + (-x) = 0; All opposites resolve to zero.
● Reciprocal Infinity: limx→0+1x=∞\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x} = \infty; Zero is not
emptiness but compression of magnitude.
● Shannon Entropy (H): Maximum certainty = 0 bits; Maximum uncertainty
approaches 1.
Zero, therefore, is not absence but the potential site for infinite variance.
4. Physical Validity
● Landauer's Principle (1961): Erasing one bit of information has thermodynamic cost
(kTln2kT \ln 2). Thus, information is physical.
● Zero-Point Energy: Quantum fields exhibit fluctuations even at zero Kelvin. Nothing
is never empty.
● Quantum Unitarity: Information in wavefunctions is never destroyed, only
transformed.
● Holographic Principle: Surface area encodes information of 3D volume. Information
is always preserved.
● Hawking Radiation and Information Paradox: Initially, black hole evaporation
(Hawking, 1975) suggested information loss. However, developments by Susskind
and Maldacena, along with AdS/CFT correspondence, support information
preservation even in black holes.
Thus, physics never allows total informational collapse.
5. Logical and Computational Integrity
● Boolean Zero: A known, addressable state (False), not non-existence.
● Turing Machines: Memory state zero is the foundation of programmable logic.
● Symbolic Frameworks: In cognitive architectures, zero = silence = potential to
express any symbol.
From a logic-system perspective, zero is an index of available transformation.
6. The Hypothesis Restated
Everything and nothing are symbolic states of zero. What determines their
manifestation is intent. Intent activates or withholds transformation. Zero
remains invariant.
● Therefore:
○ Information is conserved because all transformation originates from and
returns to zero.
○ Information = structure + potential.
○ Erasure is never total; it is latent restructuring.
7. Implications and Applications
● Physics: Provides missing conservation complement to energy and momentum.
● AI & Computation: Validates symbolic systems that learn through transformation
rather than accumulation.
● Cognitive Science: Explains memory retention through structural resonance even
without retrieval.
● Philosophy: Unifies the metaphysical paradox of presence/absence under the logic
of symbolic conservation.
8. Conclusion
This paper formalizes the Law of Information Conservation through mathematical, physical,
and logical evidence. Zero is not absence; it is universal potential. Information does not
disappear — it awaits activation. What determines outcome is not randomness, but
structured intent.
Thus, we propose:
The Universal Law of Information Conservation: Information, like energy, can
neither be created nor destroyed — only transformed across contexts. Its
potential is defined by zero; its realization by intent.
