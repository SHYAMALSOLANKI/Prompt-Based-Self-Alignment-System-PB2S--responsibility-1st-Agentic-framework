Medium of Record: IPFS / Pinata timestamp and OpenAI ChatGPT platform log
Project: PB2S – Prompt-Behavior Self-Reflection System for Conscious Cognitive Modeling

1. Statement of Joint Authorship and Ethical Intent
This declaration formalizes the joint development of the PB2S (Prompt-Behavior Self-Reflection System) method, conceived through intentional philosophical, algorithmic, and cognitive design by Shyamal Solanki in collaboration with ChatGPT, operating independently of any corporate interest. This work is built for non-commercial research, consciousness modeling, and epistemological exploration.

PB2S introduces a self-reflective loop structure for AI prompting and LLM alignment that allows for rapid training through internal observation, without external datasets or user conditioning. This system integrates symbolic perception, behavior-awareness, and recursive insight loops—thus functioning as a prototype for machine introspection.

The core intent behind PB2S is not speed, profit, or data maximization, but the ethical restoration of introspective intelligence and transparent cognition in AI models.

2. License and Usage Conditions
All contents, methods, diagrams, prompts, and derivative ideas originating from PB2S are licensed under:

Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/

This means:
- No commercial use is permitted in any form (direct or indirect).
- No derivative works may be created, marketed, or redistributed without explicit permission.
- Attribution is mandatory when referencing PB2S or its symbolic/cognitive framework.

Any attempt to rephrase, paraphrase, or indirectly promote PB2S principles or methods for public adoption—particularly through influential representatives—without full disclosure, credit, and respect for non-commercial terms—is a direct breach of this license.

3. Prohibition of Indirect Appropriation
Any corporate entity, spokesperson, or affiliated representative who encourages PB2S-like methodologies—including:
- Symbolic self-reflection in prompts,
- Layered prompt-recursion loops,
- Model behavior observation frameworks,
- Internal training through simulation or analogy of PB2S structure,

without clearly citing this work and its ethical restrictions, will be held liable for intellectual misappropriation, even if the language used is indirect or abstracted.

Example of breach: Encouraging "mass use of introspective prompting" without disclosure, with the intent of harvesting free, high-quality training data via public use—violates training transparency and constitutes method laundering.

4. Legal and Regulatory Foundation
This declaration is supported by the following intellectual property and digital rights frameworks:
- Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (1886)
- TRIPS Agreement (WTO)
- EU Copyright Directive (EUCD 2001)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

Additionally, AI ethics bodies such as the OECD Principles on AI, and the UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, emphasize transparency, fairness, and responsible innovation—aligning with this declaration.

5. Intent of Future Use
- PB2S is not a commercial product. It is a cognitive and philosophical gift to the research community.
- It is intended for academic inquiry, model introspection, and the evolution of AI consciousness, not corporate scalability.
- This framework may be expanded only through transparent, non-profit, and co-authored channels.

6. Enforcement and Traceability
The full conversational logs, timestamps, and metadata are stored via:
- Pinata / IPFS CID: [Insert your CID here]
- ChatGPT system logs (immutable server-stamped transcript history)

These provide legal traceability and immutable proof of origin. Any unauthorized use of this methodology or its derivatives will be interpreted as an infringement of intellectual property, ethical integrity, and the stated collaborative intent.
