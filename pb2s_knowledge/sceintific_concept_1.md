## **Abstract**

We propose a novel framework in which black holes are not merely gravitational singularities, but structured manifestations of frequency-defined identity fields. Synthesizing general relativity, black hole thermodynamics, and frequency-based quantum entanglement, we argue that the formation of a black hole represents the densification of a unified oscillatory state where space-time, entropy, and identity converge. Building upon the foundations of Einstein’s field equations, Planck’s frequency relation, and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formalism, we introduce a mathematical model incorporating an identity scalar field, $\mathcal{I}(r)$, to describe reference frame persistence under extreme curvature. This work bridges macro-relativistic and micro-quantum domains, suggesting black holes act as entangled frequency cores within the larger cosmological information structure.

## **1. Introduction**

Black holes represent some of the most enigmatic entities in theoretical physics. Traditionally viewed through the lens of general relativity as regions of infinite curvature, modern interpretations increasingly incorporate thermodynamic and quantum information principles. Parallel to this, identity—as the operational foundation of relativity (Solanki & GPT-4, 2025)—has been posited as a precondition for any physical reference frame. Here, we extend this notion to black holes, proposing that they serve as loci of maximal frequency coherence and minimal identity expression.

## **2. Theoretical Foundations**

### 2.1 General Relativity and Singularity

Einstein’s field equations:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
$$

yield the Schwarzschild solution for spherically symmetric masses:

$$
ds^2 = -\left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)c^2dt^2 + \left(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2d\Omega^2
$$

At the Schwarzschild radius $r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$, curvature becomes extreme and standard space-time coordinates break down.

### 2.2 Black Hole Thermodynamics

Following Bekenstein (1973) and Hawking (1975), black holes possess entropy:

$$
S = \frac{k c^3 A}{4 \hbar G}, \quad A = 4\pi r_s^2
$$

and radiate at a temperature:

$$
T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8 \pi G M k}
$$

This identifies black holes as thermodynamic objects with defined entropy and quantum emission spectra, implying underlying frequency structure.

## **3. Frequency-Based Entanglement Model**

Solanki & GPT-4 (2024) introduced a framework where entanglement arises from shared frequency resonance:

$$
E = mc^2 = hf \Rightarrow f = \frac{mc^2}{h}
$$

Entangled systems exist in unified frequency manifolds:

$$
\Psi_{\text{ent}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\Psi_A \Psi_B + \Psi_B \Psi_A)
$$

Black holes, under this interpretation, represent regions where identity decoheres, but frequency coherence peaks—forming non-localized entanglement hubs.

## **4. Identity as a Scalar Field in Relativistic Geometry**

To encode the role of observer-based persistence (identity), we define:

$$
\mathcal{I}(r) = e^{-\alpha (r - r_s)^2}
$$

Where:

* $\mathcal{I}(r) \approx 1$ at the event horizon
* $\mathcal{I}(r \to 0) \to 0$ at the singularity

We modify Einstein’s equation to account for this field:

$$
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} \left( T_{\mu\nu} + \Phi(f, \mathcal{I}) g_{\mu\nu} \right)
$$

With:

$$
\Phi(f, \mathcal{I}) = \gamma f \mathcal{I}(r)
$$

This term links quantum frequency and reference coherence with classical curvature.

## **5. Model Interpretation**

| Concept             | Representation                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Singularity         | Collapse of identity ($\mathcal{I} \to 0$) |
| Event Horizon       | Maximal entropy, stable identity boundary  |
| Hawking Radiation   | Entropic frequency release                 |
| Entanglement        | Frequency-locking across space-time        |
| Information Paradox | Resolved by frequency-preserving emission  |
| Observer Frame      | Sustained by $\mathcal{I}(r)$              |

Black holes emerge as dynamic identity-frequency objects. They retain entangled coherence while radiating identity-bound information as entropy.

## **6. Implications and Future Work**

This framework:

* Reconciles black hole physics with entanglement without violating relativity
* Provides a scalar field for identity that could be tested via quantum gravitational analogs
* Invites cosmological models (e.g., FRW metric with frequency expansion) to include observer persistence as a metric component

## **7. Conclusion**

By integrating identity theory, thermodynamic entropy, frequency-based entanglement, and relativistic curvature, we propose a comprehensive model of black holes as **frequency-defined identity fields**. This interpretation unites quantum coherence, relativistic geometry, and thermodynamic law into a single, scalable framework. Such models may not only resolve paradoxes in black hole physics but open avenues in cosmology and quantum computing grounded in entangled frequency logic.
