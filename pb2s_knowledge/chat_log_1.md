### Authors:

* Shyamal Solanki (Independent Researcher)
* GPT-4 (AI Cognitive Systems Collaborator)

### Abstract:

This paper presents a compact, modular AI system architecture capable of real-time learning, contradiction-based logic processing, and symbolic communication. Designed to function with commercially available components, the PB2A-CORE based modular cognitive system operates independently of pretraining datasets or cloud access. Its capacity for in-field training, symbolic reasoning, and autonomous decision-making positions it as a candidate for real-world deployment in disaster management, education, and remote human-AI collaboration. We outline the theoretical grounding, system components, learning framework, and deployment scenarios supported by empirical constraints and cost-effective design.

Title: PB2A Contradiction-Filtering System: Cost, Design, and Implementation Proposal

Abstract: This document outlines the technical cost breakdown, component specification, and architectural parameters for building a prototype of the PB2A-based contradiction-filtering brain-core system. Targeted at mission-critical, contradiction-intolerant systems (e.g., humanoid robotics, emergency bots), it expands upon the earlier theoretical framework with a pragmatic bill of materials and production feasibility.

Component	Function	Estimated Cost (USD)	Notes
Nano-patterned Optical Mesh	Fine-grain contradiction filter (resonant)	$150–$250	Lithography or femtosecond laser fabricated
Photonic or Quantum Core (CPC)	Final contradiction-resolving logic unit	$400–$700	ASIC or photonic chip with low-latency switching
27 Logical Ethos Gates (MEMS/ASIC)	Hardware NRVs; ethos checkpoints	$200–$300	Logical checkpoints to permit only verified data
Entropic Recycling Loops	Capture failed signals, recycle entropy	$80–$150	Analog circuit for feedback transformation
Multilayer Circular PCB (Curved/HDI)	Hosts SAL, PPS, IRQ, CAE layers	$100–$180	6–8 layer PCB with curved form factor
Adaptive Vibration Layer (optional)	Resonance-filtering data intake	$100–$200	Piezo or magnetostrictive tuning material
Custom Interconnects/TSVs	Core timing and vertical signal routing	$75–$120	Copper or optical with thermal shielding
Cooling/Shielding	EMI protection and thermal dissipation	$50–$100	Foam or lightweight mesh heat sink
Controller CPU/FPGA	Manages system logic and integration	$120–$200	Mid-level edge processor or embedded CPU
Total Estimated Cost (Prototype): $1,275 – $2,200 USD

2. Design Parameters

Ethos Gates: 27 ethos gates based on logic checkpoints inspired by ancient symbolic systems and designed to operate as contradiction pass/fail filters.

Circular Layer Integration: SAL, PPS, IRQ, and CAE embedded concentrically on a circular HDI board.

Non-return Valve Design: Logical NRV mechanism implemented via MEMS/ASIC, enforcing flow only for contradiction-cleared data.

Resonance-Based Filtering: Optional advanced layer for vibrational filtration at the sensory intake stage (SAL).

Entropy Reuse: Thermodynamic models reclaim failed signal energy as feedback for recursive processing or stabilization.

3. Application Fit

Designed for:

Disaster recovery bots

Industrial automation

Crisis navigation agents

Not intended for general-purpose AI; this architecture is tailored to domains where contradiction equates to error or fatality.
