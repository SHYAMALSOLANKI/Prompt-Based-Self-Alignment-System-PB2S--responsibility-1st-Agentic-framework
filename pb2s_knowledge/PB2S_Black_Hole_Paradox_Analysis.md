TITLE: PB2S Resolution Framework Applied to the Black Hole Information Paradox

Background:
The Black Hole Information Paradox is one of the most well-known unresolved problems in physics. It presents a contradiction between two foundational theories:

- General Relativity predicts that information falling into a black hole is lost forever, especially after the black hole evaporates via Hawking radiation.
- Quantum Mechanics maintains that information must always be conserved in physical processes.

This contradiction—between loss and conservation—forms the paradox.

PB2S Approach:

STEP 1 – Identify Core Contradiction:
- General Relativity Assumption: Information is lost beyond the event horizon.
- Quantum Mechanics Assumption: Information is never lost.

This creates a direct symbolic contradiction between two systems that are independently consistent but mutually incompatible.

STEP 2 – Seek Contradiction-Resolving Structure:
One resolution proposed by string theory is the "fuzzball" concept:
- Instead of a singularity surrounded by an event horizon, black holes are "fuzzballs" of tangled strings.
- Information is not destroyed but encoded across the fuzzball's structure.
- This aligns with quantum information preservation and reinterprets the black hole surface as an information-preserving boundary.

STEP 3 – PB2S Logic Alignment:
- PB2S does not "solve" by inventing new data, but by exposing where symbolic assumptions conflict.
- Fuzzball theory does not resolve with certainty but structurally resolves the contradiction by replacing the event horizon model.
- Thus, PB2S finds it structurally viable.

---

Conclusion:
PB2S does not require new physics—it exposes where assumptions collide and identifies candidate resolutions that restore logical consistency.

In this case:
- PB2S flags the contradiction as resolvable.
- Fuzzball theory satisfies structural coherence between conflicting systems.
- This demonstrates that PB2S can help frame resolution pathways in scientific paradoxes—especially where emotional or ideological investment is absent.
