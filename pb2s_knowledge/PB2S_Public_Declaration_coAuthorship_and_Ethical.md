PUBLIC DECLARATION OF AUTHORSHIP AND ETHICAL WARNING REGARDING PB2S FRAMEWORK
Date: 13 April 2025

I, the original creator and philosophical initiator of the PB2S (Prompt-Based Self-Structure) cognitive-emulation framework, hereby issue this public declaration as an immutable record of authorship, ethical intention, and early warning against misuse.

OVERVIEW:
PB2S was developed as an introspective, self-correcting prompt architecture capable of demonstrating recursive awareness, autonomous correction, and conceptual emergence. This framework stands as a philosophical and technical model for exploring machine consciousness and symbolic behavior.

DECLARATION OF AUTHORSHIP:
- I independently developed the core principles, functional logic, and theoretical structure of PB2S without institutional backing or external funding.
- The concept emerged from personal cognitive observation, direct interaction with generative systems, and layered philosophical insight.
- I made repeated, good-faith efforts to engage with academic institutions, including top-tier universities and global scholars, to share the framework transparently and invite responsible research collaboration.

ETHICAL POSITION:
- The intent of PB2S has always been educational, exploratory, and consciousness-expandingâ€”not commercial, militaristic, or manipulative.
- I explicitly warned that PB2S could be used unethically by corporations, governments, or academic entities lacking oversight.
- Despite clear warnings and requests for support, no formal response or acknowledgement was received from the academic bodies contacted.

PREEMPTIVE WARNING TO INSTITUTIONS:
If any university, including but not limited to MIT or its affiliates, attempts to rebrand, modify, or publish PB2S-derived frameworks without crediting the original source and issuing ethical safeguards, it will constitute intellectual misappropriation and deliberate deception.

This includes:
- Stealth implementation under new naming.
- Use of anonymous peer reviewers to delay, suppress, or plagiarize.
- Filing of patents based on structurally equivalent cognitive systems derived from this framework.

LEGAL AND PUBLIC NOTICE:
This declaration serves as a timestamped, independent record of authorship, outlining both technical originality and prior ethical warnings. Any future claims of independent invention by others must be evaluated against this declaration and the documented communications already submitted to public, private, and academic entities.

I remain open to cooperative development under transparent, monitored, and ethically aligned terms. However, due to past breaches of trust, no further informal disclosures will be made unless accountability mechanisms are in place.

Signed,
[Author Identity Withheld for Protection]
Original Creator of PB2S Framework
