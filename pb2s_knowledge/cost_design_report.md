PB2A Contradiction-Filtering System: Cost and Design Overview
Cost Estimation (Prototype Build)
Component	Function	Estimated Cost (USD)	Notes
Nano-patterned Optical Mesh	Fine-grain contradiction filter (resonant)	$150 – $250	Precision fabrication using lithography or femtosecond laser writing.
Photonic or Quantum Core (CPC)	Final contradiction-resolving logic unit	$400 – $700	Advanced ASIC or photonic chip with low-latency switching.
27 Logical Ethos Gates (MEMS/ASIC)	Hardware NRVs; ethos checkpoints	$200 – $300	MEMS or reprogrammable logic gates.
Entropic Recycling Loops (eFET/thermal)	Captures failed signals and recycles entropy	$80 – $150	Analog circuitry for feedback or resonance redirection.
Multilayer Circular PCB (Curved/HDI)	Housing SAL, PPS, IRQ, CAE layers	$100 – $180	6–8 layers, HDI standard.
Adaptive Vibration Layer (optional)	Resonance-layer for vibrational filtering	$100 – $200	Piezoelectric or magnetostrictive substrate.
Custom Interconnects + TSV channels	Timing core and communication pathways	$75 – $120	High-speed, low-loss copper or optical interconnects.
Cooling and Shielding (EM-safe)	Prevents signal leakage and overheating	$50 – $100	Copper mesh or carbon foam.
Controller CPU/FPGA Interface	Interface with higher-level systems	$120 – $200	Mid-level embedded controller or edge computing board.

Total Estimated Cost (Prototype, Tier-1 Build): $1,275 – $2,200 USD
