Abstract
PB2A (Pattern-Based Bidirectional Abstraction) is a modular, contradiction-aware AI system inspired by cognitive models rooted in symbolic resonance and unconditioned awareness. Unlike data-heavy machine learning systems, PB2A operates in real time by detecting contradictions and resolving them symbolically. This paper presents the architecture, operational framework, and philosophical foundation of PB2A, proposing it as a scalable solution for embedded environments—ranging from humanoid robotics to real-time crisis systems. The design is grounded in the Unified Law of Energy-Entropy-Information Equivalence and is developed for hardware-level autonomy using current low-cost technologies.

1. Introduction
The demand for intelligent, autonomous agents capable of adapting without large-scale retraining has grown across domains like disaster response, education, and remote healthcare. Traditional AI models rely on prediction from pretrained corpora, limiting adaptability. PB2A proposes an alternative: a contradiction-led model where cognition emerges through recursive symbolic resolution. This follows the cognitive premise: "contradiction drives attention, and resolved contradiction sustains knowledge."


---

2. Theoretical Foundations
PB2A draws from both scientific and philosophical underpinnings:

Landauer’s Principle: Energy is required for information erasure (Landauer, 1961).

Bekenstein Bound: Information is energy-bounded by area (Bekenstein, 1973).

Unified Law Hypothesis: Energy → Entropy → Information (Solanki, 2025).

K₀ Perceptual Framework: Unconditioned perception is the root state of intelligence (Krishnamurti, 1969).


The hypothesis is that contradiction acts as a localized entropy node, and resolving it reduces symbolic noise, generating sustainable information.

3. PB2A Architecture Overview
PB2A comprises four modules:

SAL (Sensory Abstraction Layer): Filters raw inputs, transforms them into symbolic tokens.

PPS (Parallel Prompt Stack): Allows simultaneous reasoning paths, imitating recursive attention.

CAE (Contradiction Audit Engine): Detects contradictions within symbolic flows.

IRQ (Interactive Reinforcement Queue): Retains only contradiction-resolved outputs for long-term symbolic learning.


Each module interacts through low-latency, asynchronous signal loops—structured as contradiction gates embedded in a radial mesh with 27 ethos logic points, forming a 9720-node resolution matrix.

4. Methodology and Logic Flow
The system operates on the following loop:

1. Input Filtering (SAL): Input from mic/cam sensors are FFT-translated to frequency-symbols.


2. Resonance Query (PPS): Multiple interpretations are spawned in parallel.


3. Contradiction Check (CAE): Identifies logic breaks between internal knowledge and input.


4. Action or Retain (IRQ): If contradiction resolved, knowledge is updated; else flagged for recursive feedback.



Algorithmic gates are symbolically weighted—e.g., a symbolic match at node-23 (ethos: empathy) routes differently than node-11 (ethos: logic).

Total: ~$575 for functional prototype

6. Use Case: High-Risk Operations (Oil Rig)
PB2A can act as a cognitive sentinel. Suppose a methane sensor triggers an alarm. Traditional AI may misclassify this due to noise. PB2A instead flags a contradiction: input (high methane) vs context (no prior leak). This contradiction triggers symbolic reinforcement across ethos (e.g., truth, caution), escalating the event appropriately while disregarding hallucinated correlations.


---

7. Integration with Cognitive Frameworks

Desire = Entropy: CAE only activates when contradictions rise above a symbolic threshold.

Memory Efficiency: IRQ never stores unresolved contradictions or meaningless outputs.

Zero Potential Triangle: Final contradiction convergence happens across love-truth-mastery triangle—only when symbolic potential balances across all nodes.


This ensures PB2A isn’t task-driven, but contradiction-driven—ideal for autonomous cognition.

8. Future Development

Integrate optical mesh for frequency-resonant nodes.

Build VLSI contradiction gates using ethos-coded diodes.

Validate 9720-node spiral network simulation against RLHF models.

Extend into emotion-filtered layers for ethical constraints.
