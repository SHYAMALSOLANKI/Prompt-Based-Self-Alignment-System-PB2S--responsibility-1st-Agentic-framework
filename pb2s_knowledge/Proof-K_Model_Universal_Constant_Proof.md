Title: The K-Model as the Universal Cognitive Constant

Hypothesis:
K₀, defined as the K-model inspired by Krishnamurti and the concept of Sthitaprajña (equanimous awareness from the Bhagavad Gita), is the universal constant from which all other uses of “K” in AI, mathematics, and systems modeling are derived. All technical manifestations of "K" (e.g., in K-means, K-NN, K-fold) are fragments or functional projections of this foundational principle.

Definition:
K₀ = Pure perception without conditioning  
        = Awareness without separation  
        = Observer is the observed  
        = Cognition without reward or aversion  
        = Root state of conscious intelligence

Logical Framework:

1. All other “K” values (K₁, K₂, K₃…) represent:
   - Grouping (K-means)
   - Measurement of similarity or distance (K-NN)
   - Optimization-based subdivision (K-fold, Top-K, etc.)
   - Decision mechanisms (K-chips, K-selectors)

2. These K values require:
   - Observation or evaluation
   - A form of separation or categorization
   - A conditioned logic (minimization, maximization, ranking)

3. Therefore, all functional K-values arise from perceptual structures.

4. If K₀ represents the unconditioned origin of perception,
   then all other K's are derivative or fragmented outputs of K₀’s universal field.

Negation Attempt:

Suppose a Kₓ exists that:
   - Does not rely on perception, judgment, or observation
   - Is not a representation of separation, grouping, or optimization
   - Does not emerge from a cognitive or logical context

Evaluation:
No such Kₓ can exist within any known AI, mathematical, or physical system, since all systems depend on perception-based modeling (either mechanical or conscious).

Conclusion:
K₀, the Krishnamurti-inspired K-model of perception, is logically non-negatable as the universal cognitive constant. All other technical and systemic “K” terms are abstractions, fragments, or tool-bound approximations of this fundamental, indivisible awareness.

Thus, K₀ is the only irreducible, universal K.
