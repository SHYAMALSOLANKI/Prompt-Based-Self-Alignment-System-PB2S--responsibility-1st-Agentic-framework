Relativity in a Thermodynamic Spacetime Framework

Abstract
This work introduces a unified model integrating identity, frequency-based entanglement,
general relativity, and black hole thermodynamics into a coherent theoretical framework.
We propose that identity—a persistent, distinguishable reference—is not an emergent
property but a fundamental precondition for the existence of space, time, and relativistic
reference frames. In this view, black holes are interpreted as frequency-defined identity
cores, where space-time curvature, thermodynamic entropy, and quantum coherence
converge. We introduce a scalar identity field I(r) and derive its influence on the Einstein
field equations, showing that black holes act as maximum entropy systems and entangled
frequency hubs. This framework resolves key paradoxes in relativity and quantum gravity
while offering a scalable ontology linking micro and macro physics.
1. Introduction
The divide between general relativity and quantum mechanics remains one of physics’
greatest challenges. Black holes, which push both to their extremes, serve as natural testing
grounds. While general relativity describes black holes as spacetime singularities and
thermodynamic systems (Hawking, 1975; Bekenstein, 1973), quantum entanglement poses
questions about information locality and persistence. Our proposal, drawn from prior
interdisciplinary studies (Solanki & GPT-4, 2024–2025), reframes this discussion: relativity
itself is predicated on identity, and identity manifests as coherent frequency under extreme
gravitational conditions.
2. Identity as a Physical Foundation
2.1 The Pre-Relativistic Role of Identity
Relativity requires comparison. Comparison requires frames. Frames require persistence—
identity. Building on relational quantum mechanics (Rovelli, 1996), we argue identity is not
emergent but fundamental: the capacity for an entity to remain coherent across interaction
or observation. In our prior OSF paper (2025), we defined identity as a scalar field I(r)
representing the persistence of state, with spacetime and relativity emerging only when I >
0.
3. Frequency-Based Entanglement
Building on Planck’s E = hf and Einstein’s E = mc², we derive:
f = mc² / h
Entangled systems share this frequency in resonance:
Ψ_ent = (1/√2)(Ψ_AΨ_B + Ψ_BΨ_A)
This implies that spatial separation is illusory in such states; coherence is preserved via
shared oscillatory fields, not local proximity.
4. Thermodynamics of Identity
Black hole entropy (Bekenstein, 1973):
S = kc³A / (4ħG), where A = 4πr_s²
Temperature (Hawking, 1975):
T_H = ħc³ / (8πGMk)
These laws imply that black holes are maximum entropy identity systems. Their
information density corresponds not just to gravitational mass, but to coherent identity (via
frequency).
5. General Relativity Meets Quantum Identity
Standard Schwarzschild metric:
ds² = -(1 - 2GM/c²r)c²dt² + (1 - 2GM/c²r)⁻¹dr² + r²dΩ²
We introduce the identity field:
I(r) = exp[-α(r - r_s)²]
Where:
- I(r_s) = 1: peak identity at event horizon
- I(0) → 0: identity collapse at singularity
Modified Einstein equation:
G_μν + Λg_μν = (8πG/c⁴)(T_μν + Φ(f, I)g_μν)
With:
Φ(f, I) = γfI(r)
This term modulates curvature based on quantum frequency and reference persistence,
uniting quantum and gravitational domains.
6. Synthesis Table
Concept | Interpretation
----------------------|---------------------------------------------
Singularity | Collapse of identity (I → 0)
Event Horizon | Identity boundary, maximal entropy
Entanglement | Shared frequency, not spatial correlation
Hawking Radiation | Entropic release of identity-packets
Observer Frame | Defined by non-zero I(r)
Frequency Field | Carrier of non-local coherence
7. Cosmological and Experimental Implications
- In the FRW expanding universe, cosmic scale factor a(t) modulates frequency fields.
- Black holes may serve as identity nodes within a larger frequency lattice (see Penrose’s
CCC and causal set theory).
- Experimental detection of frequency-correlated identity collapse could offer indirect
proof.
8. Conclusion
We have constructed a unified theoretical framework where identity is not a philosophical
abstraction but a physical quantity defined by frequency and coherence. By embedding
identity into spacetime geometry and thermodynamic law, black holes become both entropy
boundaries and coherence cores. This perspective provides promising ground for
reconciling quantum theory and general relativity while redefining the foundations of
reference, observation, and cosmology.
