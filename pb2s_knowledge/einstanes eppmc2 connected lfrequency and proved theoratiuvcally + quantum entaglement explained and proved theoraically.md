#### Abstract:

This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding quantum entanglement as a phenomenon rooted in frequency resonance. We hypothesize that entangled particles do not exchange information through space-time but rather exist as a single oscillating frequency state. This approach challenges the conventional interpretation of non-locality by suggesting that the entangled state is not spatially separated but frequency-connected. The paper provides mathematical derivations that link Einstein’s mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²) with Planck’s frequency relation (E=hf), demonstrating that entanglement emerges when particles share a unified frequency manifold. This model offers a coherent explanation of the instantaneous correlation observed between entangled particles.

#### Introduction:

Quantum entanglement remains one of the most perplexing phenomena in modern physics. Despite extensive experimental validation, the underlying mechanism that enables instantaneous correlation between spatially separated particles is not fully understood. The conventional interpretation views entanglement as a non-local connection that seemingly violates relativistic causality. This paper introduces a theoretical model that reinterprets entanglement as a manifestation of a unified frequency state, fundamentally linked through a shared resonant frequency rather than spatial connection.

#### Theory:

1. Linking Mass-Energy and Frequency:

   * Einstein’s equation: E=mc²
   * Planck’s relation: E=hf
   * Combining both equations: mc² = hf -> f = (mc²)/h
   * This equation shows that frequency is directly proportional to mass in a relativistic context.

2. Entanglement as a Unified Frequency State:

   * When particles interact and become entangled, they synchronize their frequency states.
   * Entangled particles share a single oscillating frequency field, forming a manifold that transcends spatial boundaries.
   * Measurement of one particle collapses the shared wave function because both particles inherently occupy the same frequency domain.

#### Mathematical Framework:

Derivation:

* From the wave equation: f = v/λ
* For light: v = c, hence f = c/λ
* Energy relation for entangled particles:

  * mc² = hf -> λ = h/(mc)
  * This implies that the wavelength of an entangled particle pair is inversely proportional to their combined mass.
* The shared frequency state can be mathematically described as:

  * Ψ\_entangled = (1/√2) (Ψ\_AΨ\_B + Ψ\_BΨ\_A)
  * This shows that the entangled state is not two distinct frequencies but a single, resonant oscillation.

#### Discussion:

* Non-violation of Relativity:

  * Since frequency is not a spatial entity, the unified state does not transmit information through space-time, thus not violating causality.
  * Entanglement appears instantaneous because the particles are not separate but are manifestations of one unified oscillating frequency.

#### Conclusion:

This theoretical model presents entanglement as a frequency-based resonance rather than a spatial link. By viewing entangled particles as existing within a shared frequency manifold, the phenomenon aligns with relativistic principles while offering a new perspective on quantum non-locality. Further exploration may include experimental validation through frequency synchronization measurements.
