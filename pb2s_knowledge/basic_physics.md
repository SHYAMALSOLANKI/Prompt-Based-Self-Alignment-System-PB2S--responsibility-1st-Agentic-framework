# Basic Physics Concepts

## force
A push or pull on an object that can cause it to move or change shape.

## energy
The ability to do work or cause change.

## mass
The amount of matter in an object.

## weight
The force of gravity on an object.

## motion
The change in position of an object over time.

## speed
How fast something moves; distance traveled per unit of time.

## velocity
Speed in a given direction.

## acceleration
The rate at which velocity changes over time.

## gravity
The force that attracts objects toward the center of the Earth or any other physical body having mass.

## friction
A force that opposes motion between two surfaces that are in contact.

## work
The transfer of energy that occurs when a force is applied over a distance.

## power
The rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.

## temperature
A measure of how hot or cold something is.

## pressure
The force applied per unit area.

## atom
The basic unit of a chemical element.

## molecule
A group of atoms bonded together.

## light
Visible energy that can be seen by the human eye.

## sound
Vibrations that travel through air or another medium and can be heard.

## wave
A disturbance that transfers energy from place to place.
