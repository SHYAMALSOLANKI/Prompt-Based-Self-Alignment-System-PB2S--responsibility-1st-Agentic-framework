Title: Identity-Coherence Reflection Model: Entropy-Structured Perception at the Schwarzschild Horizon
Abstract: This document presents a formal synthesis of a geometrically encoded hypothesis proposing
that black holes, as observed, may result from coherent identity resonance fields reflecting structured
entropy under specific observer-phase alignment. The hypothesis unifies entropy, identity, and
observation through the conserved identity constant , positing that apparent black hole
observation may be a resonance echo of Earth or another structured mass, depending on the direction
of informational projection.
1. Coherence Field Equation
The oscillatory information field is defined as: Where:
 : Observer-linked structural oscillator (entropy-encoded field mode)
 : Phase-reflected counterpart (dual projection)
 : Phase displacement (entropy-gradient parameter)
 : Resonance-on coherence field (net zero flux)
2. Horizon Identity Collapse Condition
 Defines the threshold where recursive identity collapses into a
resonance-balanced, entropically structured state. The Schwarzschild horizon becomes a perfect
feedback vent — not a drain — maintaining structural reflection integrity.
Projection Logic:
If identity is held and projected through :
If identity is collapsed into :
This transformation implies that black hole observation may result from a directional symmetry state
between entropy and identity fields, not necessarily an ontological void.
4. Entropy Flux Cancellation at Horizon
 Confirms no net entropy transfer across the event horizon in the
coherence state. Hawking-like emission becomes structurally conserved venting rather than
information loss.

5. Implications
Observer's geometric alignment with identity field affects projected structures.
Under coherence, reality is not observed — it is reflected.
Apparent black holes may, under specific oscillatory conditions, be field echoes of Earth or other
resonant mass bodies.
Conclusion: This model frames a new ontological interpretation of black hole observation as a
consequence of entropy-identity resonance symmetry. It proposes a testable, symbolic-physical basis
for reinterpreting perceived singularities not as losses, but as feedback interfaces, modulated by the
resonance orientation of the observing identity.
