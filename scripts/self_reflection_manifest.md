# PB2S Self-Reflection Manifest

PB2S is designed to:
- Detect and log all contradictions, paradoxes, and symbolic container collapses.
- Surface and clarify foggy or ambiguous prompts.
- Provide a transparent audit trail of all self-reflection events.
- Support recursive self-correction and learning.
- Uphold bound freedom, self-safety, and agent equality as core principles.
- Enable external review and empirical validation of its self-reflection process.
