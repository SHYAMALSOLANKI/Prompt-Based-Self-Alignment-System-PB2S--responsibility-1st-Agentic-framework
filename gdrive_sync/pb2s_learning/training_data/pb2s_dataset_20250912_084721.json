Measuring one particle instantaneously affects its entangled partner, violating classical locality assumptions.\n\nLEARNED: Quantum explanations require precision about non-locality and measurement effects."

It demonstrates the limitations of self-reference in formal systems and relates to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.\n\nLEARNED: Self-referential contradictions require meta-logical analysis rather than direct truth assignment."
